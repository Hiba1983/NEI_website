                <h1>Annuity and 401(k) Retirement Plan</h1>
                <p>The Elevator Constructors Annuity and 401(k) Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) is designed to supplement the retirement income you may receive from the National Elevator Industry Pension Plan and Social Security. This is a great way for you
                    to save for a more financially secure retirement.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Check your annual statement to track all your retirement benefits!</h2>
                <p>Each year, you’ll receive a statement showing your estimated retirement benefits from all NEI retirement plans—your Pension, Annuity, and 401(k)—at various retirement ages.</p>
                <h2>Eligibility</h2>
                <p>You’re eligible to participate in the Annuity and 401(k) Plan on the first business day you become a covered member after you have completed your probationary period and you’re covered by a collective bargaining agreement or participation
                    agreement specifying that your employer will contribute to the Plan on your behalf.</p>

                <h2>Highlights of the Annuity Plan</h2>
                <p>An Individual Account is established for you automatically. The amount your employer contributes to your Annuity Plan account is defined in your employer’s collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Elevator Constructors
                    (IUEC) or your employer’s participation agreement with the Trustees. Employer contributions are pooled and invested by the Board of Trustees for you. You’re always 100% vested in your Annuity Account—that is, you own the money in your
                    account.
                </p>

                <h2>Highlights of the 401(k) Plan</h2>
                <p>401(k) Plan participation is voluntary. This means that you must enroll in the Plan to participate. When you enroll, you decide the amount of pretax pay you want to contribute to your account. Pretax contributions lower your taxable income;
                    this means you save money now by paying less in current taxes.</p>

                <h2>When You Can Take Your Money From the Annuity and 401(k) Retirement Plan</h2>
                <p>Generally, a distribution of your entire Individual Account may be made when you retire or you become disabled (as defined under the Plan), or you die.</p>

                <h2>Weekly Income Benefits</h2>
                <p>A broken foot. A difficult pregnancy. Back spasms from a car accident. There are many reasons why you may be out of work because of an illness or injury and need income replacement. That’s where the Weekly Income Benefit helps out.</p>
