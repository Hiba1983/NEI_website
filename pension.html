                <h1>Pension Benefits</h1>
                <p>The National Elevator Industry Pension Benefit Plan (the “Pension Plan” or “Plan”) provides financial protection for your retirement years. Your benefit is based on your benefit service, applicable benefit rate, periodic benefit rates,
                    age at retirement, and the form of payment you elect at retirement. The Plan is funded 100% through employer contributions.</p>
                <h2>
                    <li>Becoming a Participant</li>
                </h2>
                <p>You are eligible to participate in the Plan if you work in covered employment—that is, you are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or participation agreement that specifies that your employer will contribute to the Plan on your
                    behalf. If you are a probationary employee, participation begins on the first day of the month after you complete your probationary period, or after you’ve completed 1,000 hours in a 12-consecutive-month period. Additional rules for
                    alumni participants apply.
                    <h4>What you need to do</h4> See the SPD and Summaries of Material Modifications for details on becoming a participant and for the Plan’s definition of “covered employment.” See the guideline booklet for employers and IUEC local unions
                    participating in the NEI plans for details on alumni participants.</p>
                <h2>
                    <li>Vesting</li>
                </h2>
                <p>Generally, you earn one year of vesting service if you work 700 or more hours in covered employment in a plan year. You are fully vested in the Plan when you complete five years of vesting service without a break in service. “Fully vested”
                    means you’ve earned a benefit that is yours to keep when you leave covered employment.</p>
                <h4>Check your annual statement to track your benefit!</h4>
                <p>Each year, you’ll receive a statement showing your estimated benefit amount based on the records currently on file in the Benefits Office. The statement assumes you’ll retire at age 65 with a Normal Retirement Pension. Compare your pay
                    stubs with your statement’s hours; contact the Benefits Office immediately if you notice a difference.</p>
                <h2>
                    <li>Your Pension Amount</li>
                </h2>
                <p>The amount of your pension depends on your benefit service, applicable benefit rate, periodic benefit rates, age at retirement, and the form of payment you elect at retirement. Using the benefit rates from the <a href="https://www.neibenefits.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NEI-Pension-Fund-Plan-Changes-Effective-July-1-2021.pdf">

                    <li>Forms of Payment</li>
                </h2>
                <p>Normal forms of payment</p>
                <h4>Straight Life Pension</h4>
                <p>The normal form of payment if you are not married is the Straight Life Pension. This only provides a benefit for life to you. Payments end when you die. If you elect the Straight Life Pension payment, your pension benefit will not be reduced
                    or the form of payment. All other forms of payment are reduced. The reduction depends on the form of payment and your and your spouse’s or beneficiary’s age when payments start.</p>
                <h4>50% Husband and Wife Pension</h4>
                <p>The normal form of payment if you are married is the 50% Husband and Wife Pension. If you die while receiving payments, your spouse will continue receiving, for their lifetime, 50% of the amount you received. As an option, you may elect
                    a 75% Husband and Wife Pension or a 100% Husband and Wife Pension. If you choose one of these options, the payments your spouse receives will be greater than under the 50% Husband and Wife Pension, but your payments will be smaller
                    (to account for the greater amount your spouse will receive).</p>
                <h4>Optional forms of payment</h4>
                <p>The Plan offers optional forms of payment, listed below. Note that if you are married and wish to select one of the optional forms of payment below, you will need to obtain your spouse’s notarized consent. See the SPD and Summaries of
                    Material Modifications for details on optional forms of payment.<br>

                <h4>What is a Certain and Life Benefit Option?</h4>
                <p>A Certain and Life Benefit option pays a reduced monthly benefit for your lifetime. If you die within five or 10 years from your benefit start date, your spouse (or beneficiary) continues receiving the same monthly benefit you were receiving,for
                    the balance of the five- or 10-year period (depending on which option you elected), If your spouse (or beneficiary) dies before you have received payments for the period you elect, payments to you will continue as long as you live.</p>
